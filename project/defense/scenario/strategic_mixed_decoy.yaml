          lifespan: 18
          heading: 270   # west movement (same as ship evasion)
          xy_speed: 3    # PERFECT ship speed mimic (critical!)

          elevation: 25

          lifespan: 18
          heading: 225   # southwest movement
          xy_speed: 3    # PERFECT ship speed mimic (critical!)

        # Strategy 2: Near-perfect speed decoy (secondary target)
        - type: "self_propelled"
          elevation: 30
          azimuth: 135   # southeast
          speed: 5
          lifespan: 15
          heading: 90    # east movement
          xy_speed: 2.8  # close to ship speed (auxiliary effect)

        # Strategy 3: Strategic proximity trap (distance score exploitation)
        - type: "stationary"
          elevation: 10
          azimuth: 30    # close to torpedo direction
          speed: 2
          lifespan: 12

        # Strategy 4: Persistence breaker (force target switching)
        - type: "stationary"
          elevation: 5
          azimuth: 270   # west (ship escape direction)
          speed: 1

# Cost calculation:
# Self-propelled decoys: 3 x 2.5 = 7.5
# Stationary decoys: 2 x 1.0 = 2.0
# Total cost: 9.5 (within limit 10)
